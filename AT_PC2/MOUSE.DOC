Atari MOUSE Driver Software

The MOUSE driver software allows you to use your mouse to
operate programs which were designed to be compatible with a
Microsoft mouse. You can use your mouse to operate programs such
as Microsoft Word, Borland's Reflex, LCS/Telegraphics'
TeleVision, and many others.

An industry standard has evolved for mouse driven programs, and
every significant mouse based program uses a separate interface
program, called a mouse driver, to communicate with the mouse.
The mouse driver is a program that is loaded once, after you load
DOS, and it remains in memory until you re-boot your computer or
turn it off.

The mouse driver program's functions were originally defined by
MicroSoft. Atari's MOUSE driver provides the exact same functionality as
Microsoft's mouse driver MOUSE.COM.

The driver software has two main areas of functionality:

1) Returning "mouse" coordinates and button status to the
applications program.

2) Drawing and maintaining a tracking cursor that will follow the
motion of the tablet cursor or stylus.


Normally the operation of the driver will be transparent to you.
All you have to do is ensure that the driver is loaded before you
run the applications that use it.


Loading the Atari MOUSE Driver:

MOUSE can be loaded two ways. The simplest way is to run the
program MOUSE.COM. 

   A>MOUSE

MOUSE will print a message confirming that it is loaded.

The mouse hardware normally uses interrupt 3. This interrupt is also
used by modems and serial ports set to be COM2. In order to allow use
of interrupt 3 by other hardware devices the Atari MOUSE driver includes
an option to use the video interrupt for mouse interrupts. To choose
this option type:

	A>MOUSE /V

You must reload the driver to change between the two interrupt sources.


Once the mouse driver is loaded into memory you are ready to use
your applications program. If you have a hard disk drive you will
probably want to copy MOUSE.COM onto your hard disk. Since you
only need to load MOUSE when you boot up your computer many
people add the MOUSE command to their AUTOEXEC.BAT file so the
driver is loaded automatically whenever they start using their
computer.

MOUSE will remain in memory, ready for use by any applications
program, until you either reboot or turn off your computer.
Remember though that if you reboot an applications disk you will
have to reload MOUSE.

The second way to load MOUSE is by including MOUSE.SYS as a
device driver in your CONFIG.SYS file. This method will have a
result that is identical to running MOUSE.COM each time you
boot up your computer.

Add the line below to your CONFIG.SYS file with a text editor:

DEVICE=MOUSE.SYS

or if you need to use the video interrupt option:

DEVICE=MOUSE.SYS /V
